This project is a To-Do Lists Web Application developed using Django 1.6 and Python 2.7. Web design was based on bootstrap and data updates are managed with ajax.
I'm using the X-editable javascript libraries for editing.

Features:

	* User authentication system.
	* User may have one or more To-Do Lists.
	* User can create, edit or remove To-Do lists.
	* Each To-Do list may have one or more Tasks.
	* User can create, edit or remove tasks for each To-Do list.
	* Each Task may have one or more Tags.
	* Tags are simply words like "interesting" or "fun".

Constraints:

	Before Set Up site, if you decide to drop down the database, create an admin Site with full-permision user. Then, configure Site 1 by setting domain and name.

	Before you run your the app, you must know what is configured on site domain. Example: Domain "localhost:8000", Name: "whatToDoNow". On this example, you must run with "python manage.py runserver 8000" on localhost. Name could be whatever.
